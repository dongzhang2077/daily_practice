/*Opposites Attract
Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.*/



//my solution:
function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
  // moment of truth
  return !((flower1 + flower2) % 2 === 0);
}
//Sample Tests

const chai = require("chai");
const assert = chai.assert;
chai.config.truncateThreshold=0;

describe("Basic tests", () => {
  it("Testing for fixed tests", () => {
    assert.strictEqual(lovefunc(1,4), true)
    assert.strictEqual(lovefunc(2,2), false)
    assert.strictEqual(lovefunc(0,1), true)
    assert.strictEqual(lovefunc(0,0), false)
  });
});
